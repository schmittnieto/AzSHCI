.SYNOPSIS
    Manages the start and stop operations of the HCI infrastructure by controlling the Domain Controller (DC) and Cluster Node VMs.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script allows you to start or stop your Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI) by managing the Domain Controller (DC) and Cluster Node VMs in a controlled manner. It ensures that operations are performed in the correct order with appropriate delays and progress indicators.

    - **Stopping the Infrastructure:**
        1. Connect to the Cluster Node VM and stop the Cluster service.
        2. Shut down the Cluster Node VM.
        3. Shut down the Domain Controller VM.

    - **Starting the Infrastructure:**
        1. Start the Domain Controller VM and wait for services to become available.
        2. Start the Cluster Node VM.
        3. Start the Cluster service on the Cluster Node VM.
